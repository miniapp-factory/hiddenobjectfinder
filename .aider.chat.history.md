#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### suggests books based on goals and interests.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. The logo file will be created automatically.

A stylized open book with pages forming a subtle heart shape, set against a gradient background from deep blue at the top to soft teal at the bottom, with a faint glow around the edges to give a warm, inviting feel.
